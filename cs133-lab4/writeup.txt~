One day late

The major deisgn decision centered around using the LockManger class and filling in its implementation.  There are two Hashmaps that keep track of the locks.  One keeps track of the number of locks out on a specific pid, with 0 representing that a write lock is out.  locks keeps track of each lock a specific transaction has.

Two additions were made to the public api.  BufferPool was given a getLockmgr method that gives out the lock manager for other classes to use if necessary.  Lock Manager was given a getPIDs method which returns all PIDs in use by a specific transaction by taking advantage of the fact that in order to get a page, you have to request a lock.

I spent around 10 hours in total, most of which was spent chasing down bugs.
